# Guess Game Smart Contracts

A decentralized lottery-style guessing game platform built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), featuring multiple game variants, referral system, and provably fair randomness using Chainlink VRF V2.5.

## üéÆ Overview

The Guess Game platform consists of multiple smart contracts working together to provide a fair, transparent, and engaging lottery experience:

- **Multiple Game Variants**: 2-in-1, 5-in-1, and 10-in-1 games with different risk/reward profiles
- **Provably Fair Randomness**: Uses Chainlink VRF V2.5 for transparent winner selection
- **Referral System**: Built-in invitation system with automatic reward distribution
- **Automatic Game Management**: Continuous game flow with automatic winner selection and payouts

## üìÅ Contract Architecture

- **OpenZeppelin**: Uses battle-tested security libraries
- **Chainlink VRF V2.5**: Latest VRF standard for enhanced security
- **Solidity ^0.8.19**: Latest language features and optimizations

## üéØ Game Flow

### 1. Game Initialization
- Contract automatically starts the first game upon deployment
- Each game has a unique ID and timestamp

### 2. Player Participation
```solidity
// Players can participate by sending exactly 0.01 BNB
contract.participate{value: 0.01 ether}();

// Or directly via ETH transfer to contract address
```

### 3. Winner Selection
- When game reaches maximum capacity, VRF randomness is requested
- Winner is selected using verifiable random number
- Funds are automatically distributed

### 4. Reward Distribution
- **Winner**: Receives ~94% of total prize pool
- **Platform**: Receives 6% platform fee
- **Referrers**: Receive 2% of referred players' entry fees

## üí∞ Economics Model

### Fee Structure
- **Entry Fee**: 0.01 BNB (fixed)
- **Platform Fee**: 6% of total pool
- **Referral Rewards**: 2% of entry fees
- **Winner Payout**: ~94% of total pool

### Example Calculation (5-in-1 Game)
```
Total Pool: 5 √ó 0.01 BNB = 0.05 BNB
Platform Fee: 0.05 √ó 6% = 0.003 BNB
Referral Rewards: 0.05 √ó 2% = 0.001 BNB
Winner Receives: 0.05 - 0.003 = 0.047 BNB
```

### Expected Value Analysis

| Game Type | Entry Fee | Win Probability | Expected Reward | Expected Value | House Edge |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| 2-in-1    | 0.01 BNB  | 50%            | 0.0188 BNB     | 0.0094 BNB    | 6%         |
| 5-in-1    | 0.01 BNB  | 20%            | 0.047 BNB      | 0.0094 BNB    | 6%         |
| 10-in-1   | 0.01 BNB  | 10%            | 0.094 BNB      | 0.0094 BNB    | 6%         |

## üîç Verification and Transparency

### Game Result Verification
```solidity
function verifyGameResult(uint256 gameId) external view returns (
    bool isValid,
    uint256 randomSeed,
    address winner,
    uint256 winnerIndex,
    string memory message
);
```

### Transparency Features
- All game results are verifiable on-chain
- Random seeds are publicly accessible
- Complete game history is maintained
- Real-time statistics available

## üìä Query Functions

    address[] memory players,
    uint256 startTime,
    bool isFinished,
    uint256 timeLeft,
    uint256 totalInviteRewards
);

// Get specific game details
function getGame(uint256 gameId) external view returns (
    address[] memory players,
    uint256 startTime,
    uint256 randomSeed,
    address winner,
    bool isFinished,
    bool isRefunded,
    uint256 totalInviteRewards
);

// Get recent winners
function getRecentFinishedGames(uint256 count) external view returns (
    uint256[] memory gameIds,
    address[][] memory playersArray,
    uint256[] memory startTimes,
    address[] memory winners,
    uint256[] memory winnerRewards
);
```
